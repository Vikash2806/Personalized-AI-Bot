Project Title: Jarvis AI Assistant
Description:
Jarvis AI Assistant is a Python-based voice-controlled assistant designed to perform various tasks based on user commands. This assistant integrates speech recognition, natural language processing, and web automation to execute actions such as opening websites, providing information, fetching responses from an external API, and more.

Features:
Voice Recognition: Utilizes SpeechRecognition library to capture user voice commands.
Command Execution: Processes user commands to perform actions like opening specific websites, providing information, and interacting with applications.
Web Automation: Uses webbrowser and os modules to open websites and applications based on user requests.
AI Interaction: Incorporates the Bard API to fetch information and respond to user queries.
Customizable Responses: Provides tailored responses based on user input and integrates natural language processing techniques.
Technologies Used:
